Task 02: Average of a List

This task builds on the work done for task_01.
Now you will need to import your task_01
and use the evens_and_odds() function
to further analyze the data.
Create an additional function named get_average()
that returns the average value of a list of positive integers.

    """Specifications

    Open task_02.py
    Import your task_01.py file
    Import the data.py file
    Create a function named get_average()
    that accepts a list object of integers as its only parameter.
    Use a loop to total the sum of the individual list values
    return the average as a float object
    Assign the returned value get_average(data.TASK_01)
    to a variable named TOTAL_AVG
    Assign EVEN_AVG the average of only the even numbers
    using your task_01.events_and_odds() function
    Assign ODD_AVG the average of only the odd numbers
    using your task_01.events_and_odds() function
    Produce a report of the data. Display formatted
    representations with commas separating thousands
    and only two decimals of accuracy.
